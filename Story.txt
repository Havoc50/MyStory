Story:

There once was a fox. He was walking in the field when suddenly he fell down a well. He had no way out. Then, he heard a goat passing by. He told the goat that there was a lot of tasty grass in the well. The goat leaped in and he realized there was no grass. The fox then used him as a stepping stool to get out of the well. Now the goat was trapped. THe fox then told the goat, "Always look before you leap".
